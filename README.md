# 2048-game

Cloned from https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048

The official app can also be found on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabrielecirulli.app2048) and [App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805)

I found this project interesting and gave it a try.

This is a DevOps project that took the classic 2048 game from my local machine to the cloud. In this post, I'll walk you through how I containerized the game using Docker and deployed it seamlessly to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk.
